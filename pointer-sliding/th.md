**Explanation and Use of Two Pointers:**

1. **`RateLimiter` Class:**
   - `requests_per_second`: The allowed number of requests per second.
   - `timestamps`: A list to store the timestamps of recent requests.  This acts as our "window."

2. **`allow_request()` Method:**
   - **Removing Outdated Timestamps (Two-Pointer Logic):**
     - The `while` loop with `self.timestamps[0] < current_time - 1` implements the two-pointer idea.  We have an implicit "start of window" (the oldest timestamp) and the current time as the "end of window."
     - We efficiently remove timestamps from the *beginning* of the list (which is why a list is more efficient than a deque here for this specific operation). This is like the window "sliding" forward.
   - **Checking the Rate Limit:** We check if the number of remaining timestamps within the 1-second window is less than the allowed `requests_per_second`.
   - **Allowing or Denying:** Based on the check, we either allow the request (add the current timestamp) or deny it.

3. **`BurstRateLimiter` Class:**
    - This class builds on the previous one to allow for burst requests.
    - It adds a `burst_size` parameter to control the maximum number of requests that can be made in a short period.
    - The `allow_request` method now first checks if the number of timestamps is less than the `burst_size`. If so, the request is allowed, even if it exceeds the `requests_per_second` limit momentarily.
    - After the burst check, the method proceeds similarly to the `RateLimiter` class, checking the sustained rate limit.

**Key Improvements and Considerations:**

- **Efficiency:** Using a list and `pop(0)` is more efficient than using a `deque` for this particular case because we are always removing from the front.
- **Clarity:** The code is well-commented to explain the logic.
- **Burst Handling:** The `BurstRateLimiter` demonstrates how to handle bursts, which is important for real-world API rate limiting.
- **Real-World Applications:**  Rate limiting is essential for protecting APIs from abuse, preventing overload, and ensuring fair usage.  These examples provide a foundation for implementing rate limiting in your applications.
- **Thread Safety (Important for Production):** The provided code is *not* thread-safe.  In a production environment where multiple threads might be accessing the rate limiter, you'll need to use a thread-safe data structure (like a `Queue` with appropriate locking) or a `Lock` to protect the `timestamps` list from race conditions.
