| **Traversal Strategy** | Explores the graph level by level, visiting all neighbors of the current node before moving to the next level. "Horizontal" exploration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Explores the graph by going as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking. "Vertical" exploration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Data Structure**   | Queue (FIFO - First-In, First-Out)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Stack (LIFO - Last-In, First-Out) - can be implicit (recursion using call stack) or explicit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Shortest Path**    | Guaranteed to find the shortest path (in terms of the number of edges) in *unweighted* graphs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Does *not* guarantee finding the shortest path. It might find a longer path by exploring one branch deeply before considering other, potentially shorter paths.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Memory Usage**      | Can have higher memory usage, especially for wide graphs (graphs with many neighbors). In the worst case, it can require O(V) space (where V is the number of vertices) if a large portion of the graph is on the same level.                                                                                                                                    | Generally uses less memory, especially for deep graphs. Memory usage is proportional to the maximum depth of the graph (the longest path), O(H). In the worst-case (skewed tree or linear graph) H can be equal to V, resulting in O(V) space complexity, but in many practical cases H << V.                                                                                                |
| **Implementation**   | Typically implemented iteratively using a queue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Can be implemented recursively (more concise but can lead to stack overflow errors for very deep graphs) or iteratively using a stack (more complex to implement but avoids stack overflow).                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Applications**     | - Shortest path finding in unweighted graphs (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm for weighted graphs is a generalization of BFS).<br>- Web crawlers.<br>- Finding connected components.<br>- Network broadcasting.<br>- GPS navigation (finding nearby points of interest). | - Cycle detection in graphs.<br>- Topological sorting (for directed acyclic graphs).<br>- Path finding in mazes or game AI (though not necessarily the shortest path).<br>- Solving puzzles with a single solution.<br>- Finding strongly connected components in directed graphs.<br>- Finding articulation points/bridges in a graph. |
| **Use Cases**        | - Finding the nearest neighbors in a network.<br>- Determining the minimum number of moves to reach a target state in a game (where each move is an edge).<br>- Finding the shortest route in a map with equal edge weights.                                                                                                                                   | - Checking for the existence of a path between two nodes (without needing the shortest path).<br>- Exploring all possible solutions in a search space (e.g., in AI planning).<br>- Detecting dependencies or relationships between items (e.g., in project scheduling).<br>- Performing pre-order, in-order or post-order traversals of trees. |
| **Suitability for Different Graph Structures** | Performs well on wide, shallow graphs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Performs well on deep, narrow graphs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
